For the three scenes, there is a title screen, a game info screen, and then a thank you screen/advertisement

for the two audio scenes I used creative commons resources that are free for all to use

for the images i drew one and then commissioned the other from a friend,

the geometric shapes are a circle and a rectangle in the second scene

I created two large texts, one for the 'studio' name and one for the invitation
